# PCAP-File-Analysis

This git repository contains python code written for my cyber security module in my final year of study.

The aim was to understand the structure and format of PCAP files as well as the format of individual protocol frames inside. 

I used Python to analyse the structure and content of PCAP files, and investigated individual frames to identify potential security threats contained in such files. I then extended my work into a more generic tool to find as many types of threats as possible.
